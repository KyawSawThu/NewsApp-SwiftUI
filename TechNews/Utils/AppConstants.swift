    static let WWDC = "\tApple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference showcases new versions of iOS, macOS, and developer toolkits for products like the iPhone and the Mac. \n\tApple has been putting a greater emphasis on augmented reality and professionalize the iPad to make it more like a real computer. \n\tThe Apple Watch and Apple TV also usually get stage time, the former often with an emphasis on health. While the focus is on software, the company has also been known to unveil hardware like the Mac Pro. Here's all the latest news from Apple's second biggest event of the year.\n\tThe conference begins with a Monday morning keynote address by Tim Cook and other Apple executives. (From 1998 until his resignation and death in 2011, Steve Jobs gave the keynote address, which the media often called the Stevenote.) It is attended by both conference attendees and the media, since Apple regularly makes product announcements at the event. Hardware announced during the address is sometimes exhibited in the conference hall afterwards. \n\tThe keynote address is followed in the afternoon by a Platforms State of the Union address, which highlights and demonstrates changes in Apple's software developer platforms that are detailed in sessions later in the week. The Apple Design Awards are also announced on the first day of the conference."
